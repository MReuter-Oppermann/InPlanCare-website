title: "Integrated Planning in Hospitals: Complexity, Analytics, Reorganization, Efficiency"
---

Welcome to InPlan-Care, the scientific network on integrated healthcare planning. InPlan-Care is a European consortium dedicated to complex challenges of integrated planning in healthcare by using and developing cutting-edge quantitative methods. Funded by the German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft - DFG), InPlan-Care is dedicated to make an impact in healthcare practice.

Our mission is threefold:
1. We aim to develop a holistic understanding of integrated planning challenges in healthcare, with a specific focus on the intricacies within the hospital setting. Through state-of-the-art research, we aim to unravel the complexities and dependencies, develop advanced quantitative methods tailored to these settings, and identify innovative solutions that enhance decision-making processes. 
2. We aim to implement these models in close collaboration with healthcare institutions in a variety of European healthcare systems. We ensure that these models are rigorously evaluated, validating their applicability in real-world settings.
3. We aim to create awareness for the necessity of integrated planing among healthcare practitioners and within the wider research community â€“ especially strengthening interdisciplinary research.

Why InPlan-CARE?
* International Collaboration: InPlan-CARE brings together researchers from all over Europe, including but not limited to Germany, Austria, Belgium, The Netherlands, Norway, and the United Kingdom. This diverse collaboration ensures a wealth of perspectives and expertise in health care management and operations research.
* Interdisciplinary Focus: We believe in the power of interdisciplinary research. By fostering collaboration between experts in healthcare management and operations research, InPlan-CARE aims to break new ground in addressing integrated planning challenges.
* Awareness and Dissemination: In addition to our research endeavors, InPlan-CARE is committed to make an impact in practice and raising awareness for the critical importance of integrated planning. We actively engage with healthcare practitioners and the broader research community to promote understanding and collaboration in this field.
