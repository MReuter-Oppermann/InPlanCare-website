In October 2023 the InPlan-CARE members gathered from all over Europe in Aachen for a 2-day network meeting. During the event, with interactive workshops, project updates, and collaborative sessions, the network members engaged in in-depth discussions, shared valuable insights, and explored the future challenges faced by the healthcare sector. The network celebrated the two first submissions of scientific manuscripts, and discussed future research ideas. 

A highlight of the event was the collaborative sessions where the participating researchers strategized on how to amplify the impact of their work. The discussions focused on bringing together various expertises, strengthening collaborations beyond healthcare systems, and identifying synergies that can drive the consortium's objectives forward.
